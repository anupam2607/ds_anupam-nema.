How to Run
Open the Jupyter notebook (notebook_1[1].ipynb) in JupyterLab or VSCode.

Ensure the datasets (fear_greed_index.csv and historical_data (1).xlsb) are in the working directory.

Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

Key Findings

Greed Days: Higher average Closed PnL, indicating more aggressive and potentially profitable trading.

Leverage levels and position sizes significantly impact the effect of sentiment on performance.
